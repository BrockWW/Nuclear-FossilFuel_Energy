# Roadmap

## 6 Steps of Data Analysis
We will base this project around the 6 general steps of data analysis, using these to guide and develop the project.
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

## Ask
We want to answer the following questions by analyzing nuclear and fossil fuel energy production, fuel consumption, and waste creation data from the United States of America:
1. What are the historical trends between each type of energy source and how does their energy production, fuel consumption, and waste production compare?
2. Is nuclear energy a cleaner, more effective source of energy when comparing the amount of fuel consumed and waste produced to the energy output?
3. Would increasing the amount of nuclear energy produced help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and how would the amount of nuclear waste compare?

## Prepare
We have collected data on energy production, fuel consumption, and waste creation in the U.S. from the U.S. Energy Information Administration [website](www.eia.gov). The detailed breakdown is as follows:

Included are links to the webpage with the correct filters applied to each dataset. We also provide the selected filters below each energy type to clarify the content of the data collected. Next, we will dicsuss our choices for how each dataset how filtered and collected, explain how we intend to use each dataset, and discuss some discrepancies that may lead to a difference in results based on the constraints of how we could select data on the EIA website.
