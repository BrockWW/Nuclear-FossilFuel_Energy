# Nuclear-FossileFuel_Energy
Data project analyzing nuclear energy and fossil fuel trends. This is not a full lifecycle analysis, but rather focuses on fuel and emissions for electricity generation only.

[Roadmap](Roadmap.md) includes a step by step walkthrough of this project created to guide it towards completion.

[Combined_Energy_Data](Combined_Energy_Data.xlsx) containts all of the original data, any unit conversions, and additional analysis done to the data for full transparency. All data sources are open sources available at the references below.

Collection of findings are provided in [Nuclear_Fossil-Fuel_Report](Nuclear_Fossil-Fuel_Report.pdf)
